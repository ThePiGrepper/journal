== nodeMCU on ESP8266 Development ==

== PN532 NFC support ==
- test pn532(w/i2c) successfully on __ANY__ platform:
  - try Rpi, STM32,arduino(let's hope it does NOT come to this).
- If success == true, use logic analizer to inspect the i2c frame.
- If needed, try to reimplement i2c module on nodemcu.

- some random info:
  - HID iCLASS support is needed.
  - HID is a branch, iCLASS is the product family.
  - iclass is also called PicoPass/PicoPass 2KS(??).
  - iclass supports ISO 14443A,14443B and 15963 protocols.
  - PN5180 apparently does NOT support HID iCLASS DH.(BUSY time is too long to fin HID iCLASS DH specification)
