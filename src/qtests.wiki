== Simple Tests and Proofs ==

* [ ] read about gcc optimizations(check mail).
  * [ ] test switch-case opt.(asm for arm&x86).
* [ ] test 8-bit unaligned access with arm-gcc.how many cycles?
* [ ] test GPIO_write() and read().inlining occurs?
* [ ] optimize rotate with gcc. http://blog.regehr.org/archives/1063 (check with https://godbolt.org/ )
