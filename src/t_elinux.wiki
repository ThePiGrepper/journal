== Embedded Linux notes ==
- sabotage: linux distro w/busybox - https://github.com/sabotage-linux
- kdump, utility to capture kernel crashes.
- VFS(Virtual File System) abstraction. Part of the kernel which interacts with the different
  File Systems using a common API.
- journaled flash FSs. ie: JFFS2, YAFFS2, LogFS.
- applications use libraries to interact with the kernel: ie: GNU C Library, glibc,musl.
- daemons,system processes, offer services to applications. ie: udev,device filesystem manager.
- applications usually are linked dynamically to libraries.
  == System Startup ==
  - bootloader, kernel and init process:
    - bootloader: highly dependent on hardware. initializes hardware, then jumps to kernel
      startup code.
      - early startup code is architecture-dependent. once done, start_kernel() is called.
      - start_kernel() does the following:
        - initializes high-level functionality.
        - mounts the root FS.
        - start the init process.
      - Setups used to bootstrap system:
        - solid-state storage setup.(all in flash)
        - disk setup.
        - network setup.(kernel(TFTP), rootFS(NFS), or kernel(disk/flash),rootFS(NFS))
