- Only put here tasks that you're planning to do later today(or in the immediate future)
- All the tasks here should be written as links to the actual task located in one of the other directories accordingly.
- Be sensible about the number of tasks you are writing here. Try to keep it to a minimum.
- Repetitive/Periodical Tasks can be written on the top just as a gentle reminder.
- The list has an implicit priority scheme. It is not enforced but suggested.
