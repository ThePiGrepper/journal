HotList Guidelines:
- This list is for tasks that are ABOUT TO BE DONE. It is list for storage of any kind.
- Only put here task that you're planning to do at most later today.
- Be sensible about the number of tasks you are writing here. Try to keep it to a minimum.
- If you are NOT mostly sure you are going to start doing it in the next few hours, do NOT put it here.
- Repetitive/Periodical Tasks can be written on the top just as a gentle reminder.
