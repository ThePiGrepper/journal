== rsync to/from another machine(VM) (ssh) ==
- example:
> rsync -aP -e 'ssh -p 2223' --delete user@localhost:/path/to/file ./
- This was used to download the images compiled inside a VM.
> rsync -aP -e 'ssh -p 2223' --delete nagato@localhost:/home/nagato/nodemcu_tools/nodemcu-firmware/bin ./
- That particular port was selected on the VirtualBox settings->Network->Port Forwarding. This will forward the Guest default IP(10.0.2.15) to localhost port.
- Forwarding Info: Protocol:TCP, 'Host IP':127.0.0.1, 'Host Port':(any available port is OK),'Guest IP':10.0.2.15(default),'Guest Port':22(TCP port).

== arch(antergos) signature issue ==
- Following error during update:
  'error: antergos-keyring: signature from "Antergos Build Server (Automated Package Build System) <admin@antergos.org>" is unknown trust'
- This solved the issue:
  This were also used, but I dont know if they were part of the solution:
  > rm -r /etc/pacman.d/gnupg
  > sudo pacman-key --refresh-keys  (this was after pacman-key --populate)
  > sudo pacman-key –init
  > sudo pacman-key –populate archlinux antergos
  > sudo pacman -Sy antergos-keyring
  > sudo pacman -Syyu
- probably only the last 4 commands were useful.

== change swappiness linux ==
- Check current swappiness level at /proc/sys/vm/swappiness.
- Change swappiness (with systemd): sysctl vm.swappiness=10
- Other important factor is cache pressure. To change it use: sysctl vm.vfs_cache_pressure=100
