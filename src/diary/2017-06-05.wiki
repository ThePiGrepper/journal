== KOMM server on nodeMCU ==
  - add init connection(aka. invite function through NAT)
  - done. It was easier than expected. instead of creating a 'server' with createServer(), createConnection() function was used.
  - it creates a TCP socket and you can subscribe to events as with the server socket inside net.server:listen().
  - don't know yet exactly what does the listen() function do different. I thought that it had to do with the events, but you only need the socket object to subscribe.
  - changing that and adding a disconnect and connect event to handle the disconection situation, and the first 'invite' packet to the HOME server, respectively.

== add static ip(only during current session) ==
  - this was needed when trying to connect via ssh to a raspberry without an available network.
  - first, changed manually the raspberry pi's ip address to a static one with the correct subnet.
  - then we did the following on the arch system:
    - set ip address/subnet-mask and broadcast ip for <device>
      > sudo ip addr add 192.168.1.119/24 broadcast 192.168.1.255 dev eno1
    - set default gateway
      > sudo ip route add default via 192.168.1.1
  - connect the laptop to the Rpi with an ethernet cable, and it's done.
