== use common folder between **nix OSes ==
- the main problem is having users in both OSes with different uids.
- So solve this, the easier way is to change the uids so they are the same.
- From another user(access as root or create a temporary user account) change the uid:
  - to know the current uid : > id -u <username>
  - change it to the new one: > sudo usermod --uid <new_uid> <username>
  - change your home directory ownership: > sudo chown -R 501:<usernamegroup> /home/<username>
  - Be sure to only have <username> files inside home, otherwise chown will change other users files to new userid ownership.
* if a temporary user was created, delete it. 

== Linux - create a new user account ==
> sudo useradd -d /home/newuser -m -s /bin/bash -G admin newuser
> sudo passwd newuser
