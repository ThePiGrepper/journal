== automount arch + thunar ==
  * This part  was tested successfully with: lxde, xfce.
  - install with pacman: udiskie udisks2
  - execute the daemon: udiskie -2 -s &
  - install with pacman: gvfs (not really sure why this is downloaded. it is NOT needed(tested with pacman+lxde) to automount successfully.

  [xfce/thunar only section]
  - I think it needs thunar-volman as well.
  - configure thunar to disable automounting:
    - go to Edit > Preferences > Advances > Volume Management:
      - Enable Volume Management
      - Configure > Storage:
        - Removable Storage: disable everything.

  - Mount to /media (udisks2)
    - By default, udisks2 mounts removable drives under the ACL controlled directory /run/media/$USER/. If you wish to mount to /media instead, use this rule:

    /etc/udev/rules.d/99-udisks2.rules

      # UDISKS_FILESYSTEM_SHARED
      # ==1: mount filesystem to a shared directory (/media/VolumeName)
      # ==0: mount filesystem to a private directory (/run/media/$USER/VolumeName)
      # See udisks(8)
      ENV{ID_FS_USAGE}=="filesystem|other|crypto", ENV{UDISKS_FILESYSTEM_SHARED}="1"

   * When tested using pacman+lxde, the /media directory was NOT created previously, so after changing mounting folder to it, mounting did NOT work. After creating
     /media folder it worked just fine.
