== openvpn client setup ==
- install required packages: openvpn networkmanager-openvpn(maybe this one is optional as well)
  * optional packages: easy-rsa
- usually, the host/server sends all the required info:
  - ca.crt
  - <file>.crt  : certificate
  - <file>.key  : public key
  - <file>.ovpn : openvpn settings. the file which gets loaded by openvpn command.
- edit <file>.ovpn so that the path to the other files is right.
- Enable 'tun' module (as admin):
  > modprobe tun
- test if module is enabled:
  > test ! -c /dev/net/tun //this file should exist
- Execute openvpn,load config file (as admin):
  > openvpn /path/to/<file>.ovpn

== change static ip/subnet/default gateway on raspberry/raspbian ==
- editing /etc/network/interfaces is no good, it does NOT work on raspbian.
- instead go edit /etc/dhcpcd.conf.
- add the static info below the device name:

interface eth0
static ip_address=192.168.1.114/24
static routers=192.168.1.1
static domain_name_servers=192.168.1.1 8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4
