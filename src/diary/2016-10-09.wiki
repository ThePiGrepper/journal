== programmming practice ==
- volatile keyword usage:
  - interesting tests:
    - difference between: an_struct volatile *ptr; and volatile an_struct *ptr;
      I suspect the second is the one you want to make the struct members volatile as well.
  - type qualifiers (const,volatile) can be placed as: volatile int foo, or int volatile foo.
  - An alternative to:
    #define UART0 ((USART *) 0xfefefefe)
    can be:
    USART *const UART0 = (USART *) 0xfefefefe.
    is this 100% equivalent?
== concepts ==
- software framework:
    - different from a normal library because:
      - inversion of control: the flow of control is dictated by the framework, not the library.
      - extensibility: a user can extend the framework to add specific functionality.
      - non-modifiable framework code: the core code is not supposed to be modified.
    - it would be nice to have create a framework for personal use to speed up development (added to simple_tasks).
