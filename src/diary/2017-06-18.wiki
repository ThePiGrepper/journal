Ideal Pool:
- find wallpaper-engine alternatives on Linux:
  - install livewallpaper (first try failed on arch)
  - another alternative is xwinwrap.

== Testing xwinwrap ==
- the following command start mplayer with nosound, looping forever and starting at second 30:
  > xwinwrap -ni -o 0.9 -fs -s -st -sp -b -nf -- mplayer -ss 30 -nosound -loop 0 -saturation 100 -brightness -20 -contrast 50 -wid WID /path/to/videofile
  - This actually works. it displays the video as-is in all virtual desktops. However it has issues interacting with Conky.
  - Conky background seems to keep the original (static?) background.
