== Arch setup ==
- installed Steam:
  - had to install 32bit libs so, edit /etc/pacman.conf and enable multisim repo.
  - install with pacman: ttf-liberation lib32-curl lib32-libgpg-error steam
  - run steam and it will update itself if everything is OK.
  - run steam(engine) to open it.
  * there are more steps and troubleshooting on the wiki, but it worked with only this with XPS13.
