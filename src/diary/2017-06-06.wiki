== KOMM server on nodeMCU ==
- implemented event notifications:
  - for get_ain_status and for get_din.
  - it was apparently easy. It's needed to test it, which brings a new issue.
  - there's no way to test this using simple 'echo' commands, because now as a mere client, nodeMCU needs to stay connected to a listening port.
  - which means that there has to be a 'host' server for the testing to be meaningful.
  - creating a listening socket using ncat is relatively easy. but sending hexadecimal data or reading the incoming hex data is NOT.
  - I'll try to do something about this, but no ideas yet.

== playing with ncat(or nc or netcat, I think) ==
- opening a TCP socket and listen to it(server-like).
> ncat -k -l -p <port>
- -k:keeps listening,-p <port>,-l:listen to connections, rather than connecting to a remote machine.
- it stays opened until the connection gets dropped by the other part, then it exits.
- to avoid sending <linefeed>, instead of sending a message using <Enter>, use eof <ctrl+D>.
- to log all communications:
> ncat -k -l -p <port> | tee <logfile>
- another ingenious use would be:
  > ncat (...) | bash
  - this makes a remote machine able to run commands on the host machine(a la ssh).
