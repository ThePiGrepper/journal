== prosody ==

- Installed basic setup:
  - installed using ubuntu repo package(prosody).
  - modified conf file:
    - Virtualhost created: > VirtualHost "localhost"
    - added log file to virtualhost setup: > log = "prosody.log"
    - admin added. ie: > admins = { "user@virtualhost" }
  - created user accounts: > prosodyctl adduser user@localhost
- some extra stuff:
  - /var/lib/prosody/ : dir to check user accounts per virtualhost.
  - /var/log/prosody/prosody.log : default directory for log (added previously). can `tail` it to keep a realtime track of server status.
- restart or other services using prosodyctl: > prosodyctl restart
- found clients for iOS and Android:
  - Android: Works: Xabber. Others tested but no (luck for now): CharSecure, XMPP Client, Simple XMPP Client, FrozenChat.
  - iOS: Works: Boogie Chat. Others tested but no (luck for now): AstraChat, ChatSecure, Monal, JabMe.
    - Some of the clients requires the virtualhost to be the same as the host. So apparently without a DNS service, they wont work.

== journal ==

- integrated diary functionality into the workflow.
