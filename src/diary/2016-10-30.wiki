- USART Debugging Tips:(by clive1):
  - The initialization looks reasonable.
  - Try a lower baud rate.
  - Try measuring the baud rate on a scope to confirm the correct/expected bit time.
  - Try a different serial port or usb dongle.
  - Try using 2 stop bits.
  - Try sending a known character, in place of whatever is in your output buffers.
  - Try a simple stand-alone application sending data to the USART.
  - Don't enable, or keep enabled, the TXE interrupt if you have no data to send.
  - Don't see the transmit code.
  - HyperTerminal sucks, try something like TeraTerm or RealTerm.
