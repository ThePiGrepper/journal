* [O] rosetta:
  * [O] buy components for testing:
    * [X] buy sim800l for testing.
    * [X] buy esp8266. esp-12,esp-3, and external antenna (i think it's esp-7)
    * [X] 433Mhz tranceiver.
    * [X] ethernet module(w5100).
    * [X] rs485 adapter.
    * [ ] CAN adapter.
* [ ] nodemcu on esp12:
  * [ ] test PoC for setting nodeMCU as wifi client and send http request to external server.
  * [ ] write server-connected IO monitor.
* [X] design esp-12-based system board:
  * [X] check I/O interface circuit (current protection maybe).
  * [X] check rosetta IO board cirtuit design and components for reference.
  * [X] design draft schematic.
  * [X] review design decisions.

Idea Pool:
- Look up for a linux utility which sends an alarm when it detects prolonged inactivity.

Log:
  - try setting nodeMCU as wifi client, and showing available networks.
  - check Rosetta I/O interface circuit:
    - draw draft schematics for esp8266-based board. create git repo.
  - checking and buying parts for rosetta lite, esp12-based rosetta lite, and future projects:
    - MBR0520LT1G Schottky diode(SOD-123) x100.
    - DS1338Z-33 I2C RTC(SOP-8) x5.
    - NE555D Timer (SO-8) x20.
    - SP3485EN (SO-8) RS-485 transceiver x10.
    - SP3485EN breakout board x4.
    - ADM3483ARZ RS-485 transceiver x2.
    - MAX14841EASA+ RS-485 x3.
    - SIM800L breakout board x2.
    - RFM69HCW 433Mhz module x4.
    - w5100 ethernet module x2.
    - esp8266 esp-03 (buy later, if needed after testing with the ones here).
    - esp8266 esp-07 x4.
    - esp8266 esp-12 x4.
  - parts to be bought:
    - can transceiver
    - varistor
    - fuse
    - resettable fuse
    - zener diode 3v3
    - BSS138 is not really needed. 2n7000 is just as good(at least for testing).
    - AC/DC converter.
