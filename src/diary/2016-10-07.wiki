- inmutability:
  - pending tests:
    - modify data pointed by a const data *ptr. test with original value and with a different internally modified value:
      - Compilers sends an error when changed directly and a warning (-Wdiscarded-qualifiers) when changed through a non-const ptr.
  - state machine example using if statements(instead of switch_case or if_else) to show why immutability is good.
  - the idea is to enter one state per function call, so the max number of state transitions is 1.
  - it is suggested to use two state machine structures. one for the current state an another one for the next state.

- Singletons:
  - good ideas for creating variables:
    - try to avoid static local variables.
    - try to decouple data and code(functions): use functions and input parameters
      (by reference), instead of hardcoding variables inside.
    - When writing libraries or modules, use static global variables to avoid external
      visibility, but create functions for modifying these(this function can be only
      for internal use(static) or not).
