- customize lxdm display manager:
  - modify /etc/lxdm/lxdm.conf file:
    To change background img, change bg=/path/to/filename (file needs to be owned by root)
  - modify /usr/share/lxdm/themes/<ThemeFolder>/greeter.ui:
    - you can create(or copy) an existing theme folder to a new folder and redirect to it:
      change theme=<theme> line at lxdm.conf to <newThemeFolder>.
    - To change images to custom ones, change line on greeter.ui to redirect to new image or change the image itself.
