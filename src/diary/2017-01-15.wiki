== Dell XPS 13 initial Setup ==
- shrink OS partition to free some space for Linux.
- change some settings in BIOS(F12 to boot mode(best) or F2 to only BIOS settings):
  - disable secureboot.
  - change SATA operation mode from RAID or IDE to AHCI:
    - To avoid crashing your already installed W10, you need to do the following:
      - open cmd prompt as admin, exec : > bcdedit /set {current} safeboot minimal
      - reboot, enter BIOS Setup and change SATA operation to AHCI, save and exit. Windows will boot to safe mode.
      - open cmd prompt as admin(in safe mode, search does not work right, so find cmd prompt in WindowsMenu>Windows System> Command Prompt).
      - exec : > bcdedit /deletevalue {current} safeboot
      - reboot and windows will be running with AHCI drivers enabled.
- now boot to some Linux installer drive.
