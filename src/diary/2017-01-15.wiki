== Dell XPS 13 initial Setup ==
- shrink OS partition to free some space for Linux.
- change some settings in BIOS(F12 to boot mode(best) or F2 to only BIOS settings):
  - disable secureboot.
  - change SATA operation mode from RAID or IDE to AHCI:
    - To avoid crashing your already installed W10, you need to do the following:
      - open cmd prompt as admin, exec : > bcdedit /set {current} safeboot minimal
      - reboot, enter BIOS Setup and change SATA operation to AHCI, save and exit. Windows will boot to safe mode.
      - open cmd prompt as admin(in safe mode, search does not work right, so find cmd prompt in WindowsMenu>Windows System> Command Prompt).
      - exec : > bcdedit /deletevalue {current} safeboot
      - reboot and windows will be running with AHCI drivers enabled.
- now boot to some Linux installer drive. be sure to boot the drive with UEFI.
- beginning to install Arch Linux:
  - some differences between regular Arch installation (see HowTo file):
    - after creating and formating the disk/partitions (you can use gdisk for this), mounting the main partition, pacstrap:
      - mount the efi partition: [NEW]
        > mkdir -p /mnt/boot/efi
        > mount /dev/<efi_partition> /mnt/boot/efi
      - generate the fstab file.
      - arch-chroot into it.
      - generate the initial RAM disk: > mkinitcpio -p linux [NEW]
      - setup the bootloader(grub): some parts are the same:
        - download grub.
      - and other are new:
        - download efibootmgr. [NEW]
      - generate the grub config : > grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
      - and install it (same as always): > grub-install /dev/<nameofdisk>
      - confirm that grub has installed: there should be a file /boot/efi/EFI/arch/grubx64.efi. [NEW]
      - install os-prober.
      - generate grub conf again(grub-mkconfig).
      * if during installation occurs an issue of missing certificates. do the following:
        > pacman -Sy archlinux-keyring && pacman -Syyu
== Linux: update partition table without rebooting linux ==
  - very useful after partition creation during installation.
  - execute the following command:
    > partprobe /dev/<disk>
