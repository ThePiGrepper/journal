- It is very possible and the obvious default use for headless devices.

== ssh other pc inside same LAN ==

- Done. Very simple. > ssh user@local_ip. it wil ask for password, and login.
- Next step: ssh to another PC. adding task on simple_tasks.

== ssh to a machine across the internet ==
- you probably will need to know the public IP of the target's network router:
  - execute the following line from the target system: > wget http://ipinfo.io/ip -qO -

== monitor hard disk/ssd health in Linux using SMART ==
- using Ubuntu install software: > sudo apt-get install smartmontools
- check if disk supports SMART: > sudo smartctl -i <disk>
- check how much time it takes to run tests: > sudo smartctl -c <disk>
- run one of the tests: > sudo smartctl -t short <disk>
- check drive stats: > sudo smartctl -l selftest <disk>
- display SMART info: > sudo smartctl -a <disk>
- display overall health of drive: > sudo smartctl -H <disk>
- access conf file at /etc/smartd.conf.
