== Arch Linux ==
- installed gnome-screenshot(default option with LXDE)
  gnome-screenshot
  - to lazy to search for other programs or configure the conf file.
  - it turned out quite useful. probably will keep it. needs to be tested more.

== raspberry pi ==
- installed arch-linux on the raspberry pi.
- made a script with the basic process.
- for adding wifi and other configurations. it follows the usual arch guide.
- installed basic tools: base-devel (many tools,ie gcc,autotools,make,etc), openssh,etc.
- installed dev tools: gcc,ninja,openocd,binutils.
  Issues:
  - tried compiling an STM32 project on the Rpi and it did not work.
  - it did not find the nano.specs or nosys.specs files.
  - Those files were not in the system after installing binutils and gcc.

== ARM Development ==
- retarget C stdLib (nano or newlib):
  - printf() without a '\n' character didnt show on the terminal.
  - It was because output buffering is enabled by default.
  - two solutions:
    - manually flush the buffer after the printf() with: fflush(stdout).
    - disabling buffering altogether with setvbuf(stdout,NULL,_IONBF,0).
  - FYI: stderr is not buffered by default. so another solution could be:
    - fprintf(stderr,...);
