== Install Teamviewer ==
- nice software. Specially because it worked out of the box in Arch using AUR.
  - look it up in the AUR: yaourt teamviewer
  - enable the daemon: sudo systemctl start teamviewerd
== add lxdm lock function ==
  - lxdm itself can go back to login screen using: /usr/bin/lxdm -c USER_SWITCH
  - use this command inside xflock or any other locker script or keyboard shortcut.
