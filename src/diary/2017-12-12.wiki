- let's try using a python script using matplotlib module.
- After trying several different examples, all of them break. probably because of package dependency.
- As an alternative, tried using VS C# on windows 7. Installation did something weird to the OS, and now some dll is missing apparently.
- For now, I'll refocus attention into the python alternative for Linux, at least for the incoming prototype demo.
- One python script with matplotlib worked fine, and it will be modified to fit the usecase needed.
