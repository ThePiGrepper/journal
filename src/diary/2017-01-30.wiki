== hp mini 210-1000 arch install ==
- there was an issue with wifi. At install, the wifi chip was not detected, so:
  - everything had to be done using ethernet.
  - a package had to be installed, from the AUR: b43-firmware-classic
  - after wifi device was detected, ip link set up <device> didnt work. so:
    - blacklist hp_wmi: > sudo echo "blacklist hp_wmi" > /etc/modprobe.d/hp.conf
    - unblock all WiFi: > rfkill unblock all
  - after that and a reboot (I think), it worked just fine.
  - installed xfce on it. it had the lightdm issue as well, already documented.
