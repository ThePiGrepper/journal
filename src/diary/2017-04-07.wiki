== Menu for today ==
* [o] design esp-12-based system board:
  * [X] finish layout design.
  * [X] understand KOMM protocol.
  * [ ] implement KOMM protocol in Lua/NodeMCU.
  * [ ] test PoC for setting nodeMCU as wifi client and send http request to external server.
  * [ ] write server-connected IO monitor.

Idea Pool:
  - create a snake game( using ncurses to test the lib):
    - maybe after doing that, try to explore deep learning with it.
    - maybe start with some simple rules(non-AI) to see what happens.
    - maybe try to use ncurses using python or rust to test the language(are there wrappers for those languages??).
  -  maybe write another ncurses game. it would be like hangman(is that even the name???) but with a cross with a shoot-em-all game (space invaders?).
  - finally, after some experience, design and write a 'Day of Sagittarius III'-like game. a homage maybe.

Log:
  - finish up board layout.
  - packaging up everything for delivery:
    - [X] Gerber files.
    - [X] BOM file.
    - Parts Library.
