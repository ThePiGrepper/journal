== Dell XPS 13 Setup ==
- xfce is great. desktop configured: theme chosen, basic shortcuts placed, and some other tweaks. I like it so far.
- tested xfce switch panel. > yaourt xfce-panel-switch
- it changes between xfce desktop configurations. you can also save your own custom configs. very nice.

== Mounting FAT/FAT32 drives with Linux ==
- to mount a FAT32, add the umask option at mount time, so you can write/modify files as a regular user.
  > sudo mount /dev/<partition> /mnt/<filetomount> -o umask=000
* it is NOT needed to chmod mountpoint file to 777 for this to work.

== testing xfce DE ==
- to use xfce terminal as a drop-down terminal(quake style),do:
  > xfce4-terminal --drop-down (hint: add this as a shortkey)
== VirtualBox: resizing vdi disk(even after installing an OS) ==
- execute this line: > VBoxManage modifyhd <yourdisk>.vdi --resize <NEW_SIZE_IN_MB>
- boot into the machine and resize the partition. the new space will appear as not formatted.
