== automount (w/udisks) from terminal ==
- this is useful to mount device without needing to open a file manager just for that.
- execute the following command as regular user(the same as usual, by using file manager).
  > udisksctl mount -b <device_name>
- to unmount, do the same:
  > udisksctl unmount -b <device_name>

== reverse SSH ==
- When it's needed to connect to a device behind a NAT, you can open an ssh connection this way:
  > ssh -f -N -T -R22222:localhost:22 root@159.203.97.143
- It basically says: open an ssh tunnel and keep it opened at port 22222
- The remote side (159.203.97.143) would only need to access the opened tunnel using:
  > ssh -p 22222 nagato@localhost
- This is a normal ssh command line, only that with a port different than the default one(22).
