== automount (w/udisks) from terminal ==
- this is useful to mount device without needing to open a file manager just for that.
- execute the following command as regular user(the same as usual, by using file manager).
  > udisksctl mount -b <device_name>
- to unmount, do the same:
  > udisksctl unmount -b <device_name>
