== Dell XPS 13 Troubleshooting ==
- damn linux display tearing:
  - fixed (apparently) by installing xf86-video-intel.
  - and creating a xorg config file name /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/20-intel.conf,
    with the following inside:

Section "Device"
  Identifier "Intel Graphics"
  Driver     "intel"
  Option     "TearFree"   "true"
EndSection
