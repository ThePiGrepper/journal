== compile vim with xterm_clipboard enabled (using PKGBUILD) ==
- download vim PKGBUILD:
> asp checkout vim
- edit PKGBUILD:
  - add the following lines to the configuration options:
    - '--with-features=normal' //apparently,this is the default, so it might not be needed.
    - '--enable-gui'
    - '--with-x'
    *right now it doesnt have i686 architecture support, so just change that line from to i686.
    - it wont compile because tcl and ruby support are enabled and they required those packages.
    - assuming you dont have them installed, delete those lines from the PKGBUILD.
    - compile:
    > makepkg
    * there's a regression test section:
    * i686 fails some test with an error stating: "test1 FAILED - terminal size must be 80x24 or larger"
    * don't know nor care what it means, so delete the test portion altogether and rebuild.
- install the packages with pacman.
> sudo pacman -U <vim_package> <vim-runtime_package> //you can also install the gvim package if desired.
== copy/paste from clipboard in vim ==
- use the "+ and "* buffers. *'xterm_clipboard' needs to be enabled.
