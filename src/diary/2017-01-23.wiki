== Dell XPS 13 Setup ==
- list of things I'd like to have working:
  - bluetooth [OK] (see the following [[2016-10-08|link]])
    - very straight-forward installation. the bluetooth symbol(from blueberry) appeared at the item bar by itself.
  - automount
  - mp3 codecs for clementine [OK] (see the following [[2016-12-26|link]])
    - added music icon to the xfce dock to launch clementine.
  - enable special keys functionality on xfce(volume keys only) [OK]
    - Apparently when pulseaudio packages(bluez-utils bluez-libs bluez-firmware) were installed, it got fixed.
    - it kinda makes sense. I think.
    - Old control panel icon disappeared,however a new 'PulseAudio plugin' became available (after installing pulseaudio, I think).
    - extra: linked Super_L key to xfce4-popup-applicationsmenu (drop xfce start menu)
    - added shortcut to print screen. download gnome-screenshot package and created shortcut using PrtScr key.
    - added shortcut to inc/dec display brightness (installed xorg-xbacklight package).
  - optimize for ssd
  - optimize power consumption
  - enable gestures and tap-to-click touchpad functionality.
  - setup conky manager.
    - run during startup.
  - setup netflix on linux [OK]
