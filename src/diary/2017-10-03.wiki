- nodemcu + pn532 NFC module
- securebox: fix gps coordinate parsing bug
- securebox: add gprs 'smart' message parsing
- securebox: add new scheduler features
- wsensor: add rtc support
- write quote for embedded project development on rpi

== nodemcu + pn532 NFC module ==
- test pn532(w/i2c) successfully on __ANY__ platform:
  - try Rpi, STM32,arduino(let's hope it does NOT come to this).
- If success == true, use logic analizer to inspect the i2c frame.
- If needed, try to reimplement i2c module on nodemcu.

== relay board ==
- ask for help on choosing zener diode.

== securebox: fix gps coordinate parsing bug ==
- create standalone test. maybe get a real gps log(already got one).

== securebox: add gprs 'smart' message parsing ==
- let's think about this. some 'nice to have's:
  - Improve gprs on-time.

== securebox: add new scheduler features ==
- Change 'ghost' extra buffer space: currently is 'BUFIN_SZ',
  recommended: 'MAX_SIZE', driver-dependent.
- dynamic throughput: when input buffer is over X% full, change
  output granularity(1/1 to 1/2, for example), this means
  basically, __downsampling__ the output. This, until buffer
  'fullness' is down again below threshold.
- Change position to integer interpretation.(what's this??)

== write quote for embedded project development on rpi ==
- create a 'semi-generic' quote for hardware development on such a board.
- create one for memory requirement of 256M and 512M, respectively.
